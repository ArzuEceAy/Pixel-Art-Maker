# Pixel Art Generator

In this project, I developed a pixel art generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to create pixel art on a grid of customizable size with their chosen colors.

## Features

- Dynamic grid creation with user-defined width and height.
- Painting and erasing modes with the selected color.
- Touch and mouse support for both mobile and desktop devices.
- Clear grid button to reset the grid.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Set the grid width and height.
4. Click the "Create Grid" button.
5. Select a color and start creating your pixel art.
